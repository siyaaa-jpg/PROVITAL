How to Run the Project Locally

    Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

Install dependencies:

Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. If they aren't, install them from Node.js official website.

Install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

npm install

Run the project:

Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the project with:

npm start

This will run the development server and open the app in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.

Building the Project:

To create a production-ready build, run:

    npm run build

    This will generate a build folder with optimized files that can be deployed.

How It Was Made:
Navbar Component:

    The Navbar.js component displays a responsive navigation bar with links such as "List your practice", "Courses", and "Login/Signup".
    The logo was replaced with an image using an img tag, where the path to the image file is dynamically imported.

Card Section Component:

    The CardSection.js component handles the display of cards showcasing various lifestyle elements, such as "Nutrition", "Physical Activity", etc.
    It includes functionality for automatic continuous looping through the cards using React state (useState) and side navigation buttons (nextSlide and prevSlide).
    The useEffect hook manages the auto-slide every 3 seconds.

Styling:

    CSS styles are separated into two main files:
        Navbar.css for styling the navigation bar.
        CardSection.css for styling the card section.
        Additional global styles in App.css.

Known Issues:

    The project currently runs only in a development environment, and may need further optimizations for production.
    Some layout issues may arise on certain screen sizes (though it is mostly responsive).
